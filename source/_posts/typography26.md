What's better than a strict, daily graphic challenge to improve yourself?

I've always wanted to start digging my mind and see what would come out from 
the love I have for typography.

About 6 months later, I've had designed 25 pieces of a work that I still 
consider as the best evolutive result since I was a student in graphic design.

I tried to represent each letter of the alphabet as abstract as possible, 
it might sometimes not even be understandable. 

Game's rule: if it isn't, I win!
