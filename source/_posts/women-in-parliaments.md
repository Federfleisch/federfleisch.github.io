The Women in Parliaments Global Forum is an independent, international and
non-partisan foundation established with the purpose of advancing society by
building a network between women in parliaments.

I built a corporate website that magnifies the beautiful assets of this
foundation: great content like pictures of members and supporters, videos and
updated agenda.
