I learned graphic design in Belgium. In a small town called Namur, I have been
exploring the many worlds of design such as web ergonomics, branding development,
logo creation, graphic and motion design.

I finally found my way in web design but I remain a jack of all trades.

Behind the designer is a boy from the 90's who loves a lot of things. As a
child, technology hit me hard and I quickly became a true fan of game consoles
and computers.

I grew up with music and I have been a guitar player for a while now. I can't
tell how many times I have banged my head in metal gigs.

Beyond that, I am also interested in many foreign languages, such as German or
Japanese.
