Symmetry enthusiast and pixel lover, I want to make the web a better place by creating shiny designs. I create rich user experience within well thought out interfaces. 

Keeping it simple and efficient, everything is about the detail.

Specialities: webdesign, user interface & experience, internet, digital marketing, information architecture, typography, logo & motion design.
